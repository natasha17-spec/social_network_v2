It’s a little pocket rocket that I recommend to anyone wanting to get into photography or blogging. In June I took the plunge and invested in a Canon 5D.I love it deeply! Though I do swap and change cameras now and then, depending where I’m going. My favourite lens is this one – UK/US as it gives you everything you need to shoot fashion, portraits or landscapes"
